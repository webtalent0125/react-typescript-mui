# Getting Started with the tech task.

Intall all of the required node module for the project

`npm i`

Once the packages are all installed run the following to start the project.

`npm run start`

This should launch the application on `http://localhost:3000`

The documentation is for Material UI is found at `https://mui.com/`

The landing page was generated following this Tutorial `https://blog.appseed.us/mui-react-coding-landing-page/`

Your goal, is the make this landing page interesting and unique. Flex your design skills and bring this basic page to life.

You are welcome to include other libraries, but please, continue to use Material UI for the base styling.

Logo images are available in the `./public/` folder.
The primary colour for the theme is `#017dc5`.

We would encourage using atomic design principles and your will find in the stories folder

`atom`
`molecules`
`organisms`
`pages`

The entry point for the application, like all react applications is `index.tsx`.

Follow the imported modules and you'll see the basic layout is as follows.

`index.tsx` -> `App.tsx` -> `views` -> `stories/pages` -> `organisms`

Most of all, have fun, don't stress. Enjoy yourself.

This is a great opportunity to learn about Typescript, React and Material UI.

NOTE: When returning the application, DO NOT include the node_modules, please delete those when returning the tech task. Otherwise the directory will be huge, even when zipped.
